========================================================
## Project Overview.

In this project, I have explored the Flights dataset and use Tableau to create  
a data visualization that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in this
particular data set.This dataset is obtained from the RITA website which 
contains information about flight delays and performance. The dataset I used 
ranges from the year 2010-2018.

## Summary.
I have done a data visualization for flight delay causes. Exploring which year,
carrier, different causes that contributes to the flight delay.After the 
exploration of The dataset, it can be seen that Flight Arrival is the main 
cause of delays and security delay is the least cause of delays.
From 2010 to 2018, the year 2017 has the largest Arrival delay 5262 minutes.
The carrier Southwest Airlines has the most Arrival delay.

## Design.
I considered important variables (Arrival,NAS,Weather,security,Carrier delays) 
that might affaect the flight delays.

Used a line chart to analyse the trend between Arrival Delay and Year(2010-2018).

Used a side by side bar chart to compare the types of delays across the year.

Finally in Dashboard, used a filter based on Airport, to analyse how each factor
varies in  the listed Airports of dataset.

After getting the  feedback I edited the captions in Tableau and edited the
titles wherever necesssary.

From my project review , I got the feedback  to Change "Dashboard 1" into a 
better meaningful title ,so I edited the name and changed it to Flight Delays
Key Performance Indicators (KPI).


## Feedback.
Following are the feedbacks I got:

Add details in the caption, about your inference in each sketch.

Add important findings in the Final story caption.

Make sure every plot have a separate clear and legitimate title.

Change "Dashboard 1" into a better meaningful title that gives readers the main idea of your project.
